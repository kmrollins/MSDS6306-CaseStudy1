*Draft - Beers and Breweries

#Introduction:

“In 2017, 83 percent of all beer was domestically produced, and 17 percent was imported from more than 100 different countries around the world. Based on beer shipment data and U.S. Census population statistics, U.S. consumers 21 years and older consumed 26.9 gallons of beer and cider per person during 2017.” -

Consumers have many options on the choice of beer they drink today. The beer industry is saturated with regards to production and consumption over the past 10 years, to ward off competition, and position in the market, it is imperative that the brewing companies have to come up with new strategies. However, large breweries still are having the majority market share.

Now this study is conducted to help one of our clients on a marketing campaign. This analysis would determine certain important questions on the Beer and Breweries information for a calculated and appropriate decision. The analysis would also include Alcoholic content and IBU (international bitterness unit) to position the product with competition from other beer manufacturers including craft beer industry. Enough sample data is provided to conduct the study and analysis.

# Background

Our client Anheuser Busch limited and its CEO Mr Michel Doukeris is eager to introduce a new Beer with optimum alcoholic content (ABV) and international bitterness units (IBU), so that they can compete with other breweries and position itself in the market to regain its top performance slot. This will be an important feature in their marketing campaign and advertisement for the product in the upcoming NFL halftime commercial (Most watched) with enhanced visual effects.  The strategy would create awareness and curiosity around this new beer with their consumers (Budweiser enthusiasts!).

*Company features:

 a. Head quartered in St Louis MO.

 b. Brews more than 100 brands.
 
 c. Flag ship - Budweiser and Budlight brands.
 
 d. Owns 23 breweries.
 
 e. Has several craft partners, agricultural facilities and can lid plants.
 
 f. 14 Billion in revenue per year. " - source - company website.
 
Launching on this project required some quick but a deeper research of the industry and understanding of the competition involved. 
Marketing survey analysis were researched to see what level of ABV and IBU were preferred by its consumers to come up with the best tasting beer.
Also watched some marketing commercials from competitors to strategize on its advertisement campaign.  
Research on beer industry brewery terminologies were done, which includes the following:
IBU – International bitterness unit:
“IBU is a popular use of measurement of bitterness in beer. The IBU calculations are made using complex formula based on certain variables such as hops used, how long the hops are boiled in the wort, wort density, volume of wort etc.
The obscurity of the bitterness taste is more if there is more malt and sweetness added to it.  The upper limits of IBU is usually around 100. Hops can increase bitterness in beer and they can be flavors such as pine, mint, herbs etc.
Alcoholic content (Alcohol by volume-ABV):
“Beer 101: All About Alcohol by Volume (ABV) Alcohol by volume, or ABV, is used to measure the alcohol content of beer, wine, distilled spirits, and other alcoholic beverages. Beers typically fall in the 3.0-13.0% ABV range, though some can be weaker or stronger than this”-

Alternatives/Extensibility: The study can also be used to set up new breweries in various locations to have them locally to satisfy the market demands. The study can also be conducted on pricing the product appropriately to ward off competition at the same time reduce the cost by positioning breweries nearer to the raw material available areas so the transportation is minimal.

Since the CEO was specific on his request on the research study, no new alternatives were considered for the study though they may be weighed in on a future date for an indepth analysis.

# Solution

We have come up with some salient information on the data to present to the CEO for his decision:

1.	State wise number of Breweries present to gauge the competition. 

2.	Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.

3.	Report the number of NA's in each column.

4.	Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

5.	Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

6.	Summary statistics for the ABV variable.

7.	Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
