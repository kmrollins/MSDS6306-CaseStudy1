# U.S. Beer and Brewery Case study
# K n A Marketing Consultants, 12 Wall street, NY

The Purpose of this project is to present a report to our client Anheuser-Busch Ltd and its CEO Mr. Michel Doukeris on the findings.
This will enable our client a choice of a new product line to position the company against competition and regain the reigns as King of Beers!

# Questions to be addressed

Our client presented us with 7 questions, all of which will be answered through our analysis.

1.	How many breweries are present in each state?
2.	Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.
3.	Report the number of NA's in each column.
4.	Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
5.	Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
6.	Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
7.	Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.

# File Organization

**Folders:**
* CaseStudy1_files - Contains images of plots used in our analysis
* DataFiles - Contains the original beer and brewery data provided by our client
* PresentationSlides - Contains slides used in supplemental video presentations

As we performed our analysis in R, we used the *knitr* package to combine the code with our explanations and analysis. There are several files with the same name but different file extensions, each with a different purpose.

**CaseStudy.\* Files:**
* .Rmd - Rmarkdown document with all of our R code and full analysis
* .md - Markdown document with our full analysis excluding code, knitted from Rmarkdown, viewable on GitHub
* .html - HTML version of our full analysis excluding code, knitted from Rmarkdown

# Conclusion

By performing data analysis to answer relevant questions presented in the study, we are able to provide marketing recommendations to the CEO of Anheuser-Busch. Our advice includes launching a new product in the top 10 beer producing and consuming states, developing optimal alcohol content and bitterness levels for the product, and partnering with local craft beer breweries. We believe that implementing these strategies supported by insights from data will increase sales and re-position the company as the leader of the U.S. beer industry.
